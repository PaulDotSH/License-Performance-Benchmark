# TODO
- Make some scripts (Python or Rust) to generate the sample data needed for the benchmarks
- Make a binary to run the benchmarks and generate some graphs
- Create more benchmarks i.e. various text processing and analysis, "cheap" (computationally-wise) backend (some simple CRUD with ORM and/or simple driver), "expensive" backend with complex calculations
